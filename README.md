# Speech Recognition Client/Server and Desktop Application

The software being developed in this project uses OpenAI Whisper technology to input text via speech and use the resulting text in any other application.

Natural language processing often requires a lot of resources. It makes sense to use a graphics card, which greatly speeds up the processing of recorded speech files. Therefore, the processing of speech with this software should be realizable in two ways:

- Local processing: the speech is recorded on the local computer, processed and transferred to local applications.
- Decentralized processing: The speech is recorded locally and processed into a character string on a remote computer (GPU server) and transferred back to the source computer as a character string. There, the text is then transferred to local applications.



## Installation

### Microsoft Windows

The following command must be executed in a terminal window (cmd):

```
    .\bin\prepare.bat
```

### Linux

Run the following command in a shell:

```
    bash ./bin/prepare.sh
```


## Start the application

### Microsoft Windows

Use the following command in a terminal window (cmd):

```
    .\run.bat
```

### Linux

Run the following command in a shell:

```
    bash ./run.sh
```


## Usage

The program contains the following setting options:

- Model: This is a selection of the OpenAI Whisper model. Smaller models are faster but also more imprecise.
- Language: The original language.
- Task: "transcribe" means, that the text is created in the original language. "translate" means, that the text is translated to English.
- Format: "normal" takes the text from the Whisper model as is, while "stripped" means, that leading and trailling whitespaces are omitted. Stripped text is preffered, when working with spread-sheets or presentation programs, while "normal" is including white spaces - so it is preffered for floating text.
- Pause: The processing of speech starts after a little break. This parameter determines the duration length of this break.
- Active: Determines whether audio data should be processed or not.
- Insert via CTRL-V: Defines whether the system automatically puts the recognized text into the system clipboard and the CTRL-V key combination is automatically pressed.

The text input field contains the recognized text.
